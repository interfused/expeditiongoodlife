We recommend using the free [Google Analytics by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/) plugin for this. You'll have to enable "Track outbound click and downloads" on its settings page and set the slug you're using for your affiliate links in the advanced "Set path for internal links to track as outbound links" setting as well.
