Spam Protect for Contact Form 7 is an awesome and easy-to-use plugin to block all those spammers (or bots) who fill out forms on your website. 
The plugin adds an extra tab on each Contact Form 7 edit screen where you can add emails, domains and/or words and phrases that you want to block.
Spammers and Bots usually fill your Contact Form 7 and submit unwanted and useless data, ADs and contact information to you.
Their e-mail is usually from the same domain and they use common words to submit some sort of commercial marketing info.
Just add those emails, domains and maybe words or phrases in the block settings and block the form submission and show them a custom error message.
